TODO list

-BOTH estimated fuel use for flight should not be allowed to be less than the fuel in the tanks

-BOTH put plane Basic empty weight and arm at top of input form

-plus I have to consider how the fuel burn factors in to different things

-BOTH put estimated flight time before reserve in the output somewhere

- BOTH add a thing to the chart generating code, IF points to plot are way off scale in any direction,
  to clearly indicate on the face of it so it doesn't look like the chart failed to plot the points, 
- Label the UTILITY AND NORMAL envelope areas on the chart

-adjust text on the chart indicating Take off and landing Centre of Gravity so it does not go off
the edge of the canvas

-remove spinners from number inputs

-add way to save results somewhere. G drive or email or something. Try using JSON  :) more new to learn

-maybe put input fields in a table  xxxx not table, learn and implement CSS to layout properly
-put the text output in a table so it is easier to read.

-REVIEW all information (text and calculations) to make sure it is accurate



-add display standard weights for fuel and oil for both metric and the other thing in information section
-add conversion for kg  < -- > lbs
-add conversion for usg < -- > litres
-add input weights to the image and add output values to the image

   <h2>Weight and balance calculator for Cessna 172M C-GEFH</h2>

   <p>
      This calculator uses javaScript to make the calculations, so it will not work on web browsers with javaScript turned off.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please read below how these calulations are performed and the information that the calculations are based on. Remember, as always, it is the responsibility of the PIC to veriify the information is correct and make the final decision for the flight.

   <p>
      The weight and balance calculations are based on the information provided on the "Weight and Balance" document descibed below and is not valid otherwise.<br>
      This Weight and Balance calculator is for Cessna 172M, C-GEFH, serial # 17265436 only. <br>
	  All of the Weight position and arms used for the calculations are from the POH based on the average position for each of the loads. If unusual loadings are needed then you should not use this calculator and consult the POH for more information.
	  The Basic Empty Weight and Arm for this airplane have been taken from the "Weight and Balance amendment #4" document dated May 22 2020. If there is a newer Document than listed here, then this calculator is not to be used and should be updated with the most current information before it is used again.
	  <br><br>
	  It is the hope of the author that you find this Web page based calculator intuitive and easy to use. <br>If you have any input on a feature to add or an error exists, <br>then an email to p_hoffer1@hotmail.com referencing this page is welcomed.
