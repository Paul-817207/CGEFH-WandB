# CGEFH-WandB
This is a sister project to the CFSBM-WandB project.
The purpose is to have an easy to use web based calculator to determine the weight and balance of a specific airplane, namely the Cessna 172M C-GEFH owned by the Woodstock Flying Club.
This was first developed as a Weight and balance calculator for the WOFC owned J3C cub with is simpler to implement and hence why that one was completed first as I learned the html and JavaScript code to achieve what I wanted.
